\textbf{Description}: Santa is trying to deliver presents in a large apartment building, but he can't find the right floor - the directions he got are a little confusing. He starts on the ground floor (floor 0) and then follows the instructions one character at a time. An opening parenthesis, \mintinline[fontsize=\footnotesize]{javascript}{(}, means he should go up one floor, and a closing parenthesis, \mintinline[fontsize=\footnotesize]{javascript}{)}, means he should go down one floor. The apartment building is very tall, and the basement is very deep; he will never find the top or bottom floors. \\
